## About

This project is about a simple dashboard website made by solely using CSS Grid. The project displays responsiveness in different display sizes and prioritizes precise content placement.

### Features

Here is a short summary of the website:

- Made only by using CSS Grid in each and every element.
- The overall layout is achieved from the lesson's example image.
- Made responsive by using dynamic values such as rem and fr.
- It consists of 2 rows and 2 columns by doing the following:

```
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 6fr;
    grid-template-rows: auto 1fr;
```

## What I Learned

I learned about the use-case of CSS Grid because I was able to understand its power and strength. By combining CSS Grid with CSS Flexbox on my projects, I will be able to maintain a responsive, consistent, and precise layouts. For me, this is important because I believe that good developers have a good understanding of the very fundamentals of building websites.

After finishing this project, I am now confident in building good layouts by combining both content flow and content placement in my arsenal of tools for web development.
